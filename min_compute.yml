general_requirements:
  deployment:
    - "Prefer bare-metal or dedicated cloud instances to avoid noisy-neighbour I/O penalties"
    - "All drives should be NVMe with latency < 100 µs and ≥ 100k IOPS"
    - "SATA SSDs will bottleneck archive reads"
    - "Stripe two NVMe drives (RAID 0) on Ethereum if budget permits—doubles IOPS for big syncs and heavy tracing"
  
  storage_growth:
    ethereum: "~0.5 TB/year"

  bandwidth_notes:
    - "1 Gbps provides comfortable headroom"
    - "Miners in bandwidth-constrained regions should cap RPC concurrency to avoid latency penalties"
