# SN97 - FlameWire: Decentralized Infrastructure

**FlameWire** is a specialized **subnet within the Bittensor network** designed to provide **decentralized RPC, node, and API services** for multiple blockchains.

Like Alchemy, Ankr, or other infrastructure providersâ€”but fully decentralized FlameWire democratizes blockchain infrastructure access, beginning with **Ethereum**, **Bittensor**, and **Solana**, and expanding further.

---

## Overview

- **Decentralized infrastructure** for RPC and API services  
- **Multi-chain support**: Ethereum, Bittensor, Solana (and more coming)  
- **Scalable, secure, and resilient** architecture  
- Designed for developers, validators, and network operators

---

## Key Components

### Miners  
Provide the underlying infrastructure:

- **Multi-Chain Node Operators**: Serve Ethereum, Bittensor, Solana, etc.  
- **Global Coverage**: Deploy nodes across regions for low-latency access  
- **Redundant Infrastructure**: Ensures continuous service availability  
- **Secure Communication**: Verified via cryptographic signatures  
- **Scalability**: Easily extend node capacity as demand grows  

### Validators  
Ensure performance and honesty of the network:

- **Uptime Monitoring**: Ensure consistent availability of nodes  
- **Integrity Verification**: Validate correctness of RPC/API responses  
- **Performance Evaluation**: Monitor latency, reliability, and throughput  
- **Weight Allocation**: Assign performance-based rewards  
- **Honesty Checks**: Detect and penalize misbehavior or downtime  

### Subnet Owner  
Coordinates and manages network activity:

- **Traffic Direction**: Distributes API/RPC requests to optimal nodes  
- **Access Management**: Controls permissions for users and developers  
- **Network Optimization**: Improves performance and resource efficiency  

---

## Economic Model

- **Stake-Based Free-Tier Access**: Users get free access based on staked Alpha Tokens  
- **Pay-as-you-go**: Developers pay based on resource consumption  
- **Circular Tokenomics**: Payments are recycled into subnet liquidity  
- **Performance-Based Rewards**: High-quality service providers earn more  

---

## Workflow

### Registration and Configuration

- Miners register nodes for supported blockchains  
- Validators begin monitoring uptime and performance  

### User Access

- Developers and users connect via Flamewire APIs  
- Requests are routed intelligently based on region, load, and performance  

### Evaluation and Rewards

- Validators assign scores and weights to miners  
- Alpha token rewards are distributed based on performance  
- User payments re-enter the subnet economy

## Competitive Advantages

- **True Decentralization**: No central point of control or failure  
- **Cost Efficiency**: Competition reduces access costs  
- **Global Availability**: Regional node access ensures speed and uptime  
- **Resilient Architecture**: Built-in redundancy across providers  
- **Unified Multi-Chain Access**: One platform for multiple blockchains  
- **Stake-Driven Free Access**: Lowers barriers for new users  

---

## Development Directions

- Expansion to additional blockchains  
- Introduction of chain-specific APIs  
- Enhanced monitoring and analytics tools  
- Foundation partnerships for staked-access models  
- AI-based optimization of request routing
